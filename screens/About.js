						In the United States alone, there's a staggering $100 billion
						backlog of trail maintenance awaiting attention. Thankfully, Trail
						Maintenance Organizations are the unsung heroes doing the heavy
						lifting. They work hand in hand with the BLM, Forest Service, and
						other land managers to meticulously plan, construct, and maintain
						trails and their accompanying infrastructure.
					</Text>
					<Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>
						Take, for instance, the incredible Palisade Plunge trail. From its
						inception to its grand opening, it took an astonishing ten years of
						dedication and hard work.
					</Text>
					<Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>
						However, these organizations are predominantly powered by volunteers
						and are often lacking the necessary resources. Despite their
						remarkable efforts, they operate without the support of substantial
						funding. And that's where we come in.
					</Text>
					<Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>
						Recognizing that land managers simply don't have the funds to make a
						significant dent in the trail maintenance backlog, we're determined
						to change the status quo. Through user-determined donations, we
						enable you to prioritize the trails that matter most to you.
					</Text>
					<Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>
						Think of us as the "Switzerland" of trail funding apps. Our goal is
						to ensure that a minimum of 80% of your donation directly benefits
						trail organizations, providing them with an additional funding
						stream and access to cutting-edge technology.
					</Text>
					<Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>
						As a B-corp, Trail Funds is proud to call the Maverick Innovation
						Center at CMU our home. By basing ourselves within this vibrant
						community, we actively contribute to the very communities we strive
						to serve.

					<Text>
						Join us in our mission to breathe new life into our trails.
						Together, we can make a lasting impact and create a trail system
						that we can all be proud of.
